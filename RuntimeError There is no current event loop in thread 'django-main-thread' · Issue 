Hi, I'm trying to integrate ib-insync with django using django-channels to get real time data from interactive brokers using a socket and using reqTickByTickData. But I'm struggling with the initial connection.

I wrote this line of code in services.py:

```
import json, nest_asyncio, asyncio
from ib_insync import *
ib = IB()
def connect_to_ib(): 
    print("Starting IB")
    ib_connection = ib.connect('127.0.0.1', 4002, clientId=1,timeout=4, readonly=False, account='')
    print("IB is Connected?", ib.isConnected())
    return ib_connection 
```

but I'm getting this error:

`RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'django-main-thread'`

It worked in the past briefly and get an ib Object but I don't know why It fails now.

I read [#33](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync/issues/33) and [#167](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync/issues/167) in order to solve this error but the problem persist.

```
def create_evenloop():
    print("Starting Event Loop")
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    nest_asyncio.apply() 
```

Those functions were called in a consumer in django channels, (normally django is blocking but AsyncWebsocketConsumer from channels make non-blocking code inside PlotterConsumer class )

```
class PlotterConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    create_evenloop()
    ib = connect_to_ib()
    ... 
```

🤣 [@juan9222](https://github.com/juan9222) checkout [#262](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync/issues/262) and [#264](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync/issues/264).

The long story short is there is no synchronous api for you to use currently and if you want to integrate `asyncio` with other concurrency frameworks you have to know what you're doing. Nesting event loops will do nothing to help (and generally speaking is a dirty hack anyway).

So it means that i have to use IB API obligatorily?

no, I think goodboy has exaggerated the situation a bit in his response.

You can use ib\_insync with any asyncio framework, but you should be careful to call async functions only, since all the sync-functions use the patching on the build-in python asyncio loop, which is obviously not working when you use non-native event loop. So, basic idea with any app which already has async-io capabilities - (1) start the app and it's own event loop, (2) call all only "async def xxxAsync()" functions from ib\_insync framework (from your app's async functions)

The best place to look how it is done and ask additional questions is probably the ib-insync discussion group, which has plenty of posts on the subject

[@juan9222](https://github.com/juan9222) no it means to use it with a non-`asyncio` framework (in an actual synchronous way) you have launch `ib_insync`'s event loop in another thread (just like you have to with every single-threaded asynchronous I/O system ever). If you want to understand the details just read [#262](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync/issues/262).

Don't worry this isn't your fault. The documentation is extremely unclear about this.

To be honest I saw all topics about this error in [https://groups.io/g/insync](https://groups.io/g/insync) but I still don't get it.

I used keywords "runtime error" and "django", but I didn't saw something useful about it to apply inside my code.

I already did this on settings.py while I was reading this [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/async/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/async/) in order to enable async support. But it was futile.

```
os.environ["DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE"] = "true" 
```

I already worked with async code with Javascript and Node.js .I know a little bit about concurrency and event loops applied to async code. But I think I'm missing something important about it under the hood.

I nested the event loop because I was getting another error

```
RuntimeError: Cannot run the event loop while another loop is running 
```

In the forum they don't talk about django-main-thread, and everyone with Runtime error refers to 'Dummy-Thread' instead.

In [#262](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync/issues/262) I read about future improvements to the library. Specially for sync users, but honestly It's way better work in async mode (regardless I didn't implemented it on my own code). I just need to connect.

Honestly I got everything working using IB API but I want to make it with ib\_insync because it abstracts IB API pretty good in a async way (and it's working fine in a single code outside my django project) It's like a conflict between django and ib\_insync.

Do I have to install tornado (or another asyncio framework) in order to work properly? (I'm using django-channels tho)

I think I partially solved my problem following your instructions.

```
(1) start the app and it's own event loop 
```

Inside my django channels consumer class I have a coroutine method called "price" and inside it I put `await create_evenloop()` like this:

```
 async def price(self, event):
        await create_evenloop()
        ib = await connect_to_ib()
        message =  "Hi"
        await self.send(text_data=json.dumps({
            'message': message
        })) 
```

A pair of awaits inside the coroutine for create event loop and for ib connect method.

```
 (2) call all only "async def xxxAsync()" 
```

Then I just rename my functions as coroutines with `async def create_evenloop():` and `async def connect_to_ib():`

but I'm getting this error right now

```
RuntimeError: Cannot enter into task <Task pending name='Task-12' coro=<RedisChannelLayer._clean_receive_backup() 
```

I'm using redis for caching.

I think this topic is more appropriate for [https://groups.io/g/insync](https://groups.io/g/insync). That group is quite active and I am sure people will be able to help you there.

> `RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'django-main-thread'`

It's probably just a matter of deploying it properly for asyncio:  
[https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploying.html#configuring-the-asgi-application](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploying.html#configuring-the-asgi-application)

That should present a running event loop, and after that it's a matter of using async-compatible code only, as [@drusakov778](https://github.com/drusakov778) already said. This includes connectAsync instead of connect.

Creating a new event loop, nesting the loop or running in a separate thread is all unnecessary.

Thank you [@goodboy](https://github.com/goodboy), [@erdewit](https://github.com/erdewit) and [@drusakov778](https://github.com/drusakov778) for your help. You guys are right, I didn't had the need to use nest\_asyncio or create a new event loop. Everything was running inside django's main thread so I was forced to write async code only to make it work properly. I solved my problem this way:

```
from ib_insync import *

async def connectToIB(): 
    ib = IB()
    print("Starting IB")
    ibConnectionPromise = ib.connectAsync('127.0.0.1', 4002, clientId=1,timeout=4, readonly=False, account='')
    return ibConnectionPromise
    
async def requestTick(ibConnectionPromise):
    ib = await ibConnectionPromise
    currentTimePromise = ib.reqCurrentTimeAsync()
    currentTime = await currentTimePromise
    currentTimeString = currentTime.strftime("%d-%b-%Y (%H:%M:%S.%f)")
    return currentTimeString

async def disconnect_to_ib(ibConnectionPromise):
    ib = await ibConnectionPromise
    ib.disconnect() 
```

Right now I'm continuing the issue trying to get real time data in the forum that [@drusakov778](https://github.com/drusakov778) mentioned above, right now it's pending to approve [https://groups.io/g/insync/topics](https://groups.io/g/insync/topics).
